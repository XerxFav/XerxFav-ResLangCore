## Phase Logic
ResLang operates on ternary, phase-based transitions. Each module reflects a distinct ontological layer.

### Modules

- **phase**: Encodes logical transitions and ternary states

## Dependencies
- `phase` depends on `chronotope`
- `fieldcore` synthesizes headers into executable phase maps
